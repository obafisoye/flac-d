# FLACd
## Overview
Music has always been a vital form of expression and connection. However, in the current landscape, music discovery is often driven by algorithms rather than personal recommendations.

FLACd addresses the gap between algorithm-driven discovery and personal curation. The platform will allow users to share their taste in music, discover new music through their social network, and create customizable, shareable lists.

## Features
- **Browse Albums:** Search and explore albums fetched from the Discogs API.
- **Responsive Design:** Seamless user experience across devices.
- **User Profiles:** Users can create profiles with their name, email, bio and upload an avatar.
- **List Curation**: Users can create lists of albums and give them a title and a description.

## Installation
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- **Android Studio** installed (latest stable version recommended).
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or higher installed.
- **Android SDK** set up.
